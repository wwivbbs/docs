I do recall a screamed "Oh, F*ck!" followed by TH flipping me off mid-bounce.
I really don't feel all THAT special, seeing as he decided to flip off
everyone driving through town the following day.

I might point out that I left my glasses on the ground before I even climbed
the tower, but I won't bother to do so. :)

It was also observed that White Queen was the only WWIV sysop present without
(noticeable?) facial hair.  I don't recall 100% about Maintech, but I think we
all were using some sort of tobacco by-product with the exception of TH.

Actually we only slept until around 11am.  At that point, we started attacking
the alcohol once again.  Hey, what can I say- my cars were all at least 600
miles away so I had nothing to lose!
As for Snorkel, who knows.... he dropped in around 11 and was never seen from
again until around 9:30 or so.
What *DID* he and those scantily clad women do all day?

What self-respecting Oompah band plays Garth Boorks' "Two Pina Coladas" anyway?
Since when is Country considered to be German????

Dave took this opportunity to mention he wished he had his camera to get a shot
of Hobbit waggin' his butt.
I'm not 100% positive on why he wanted that, but to retain what little is left
of my sanity I'm assuming he thought it would be humorous.

Or three or four or five... or even coffee for some of us.
I even inflicted one new song by Blue Oyster Cult on the assembly.  That's not
bad considering that for the trip down and back we only had three tapes of
note, ones I grabbed from my van before leaving Dave's... all BOC.

"All interested" was two people by my recollection.  Well, one person and
myself.

So, TJ... what ARE those "ENRSA.C" and "DERSA.C" files for anyway?  Perhaps
Jayson would rather explain, since RSA encoding isn't used according to him....

Varied discussion= Hobbit's \BESTIALITY directory, and the fact that he needs a
set of jumper cables to get his computer up and running. <g>
I'm wearing my shirt right now, BTW.  The black one, that is.  The white one is
being saved for other occasions.

So, TJ... why WERE you wearing those sunglasses even when you came into our
room?
Were you hung over or not? <g>
Before answering, keep in mind that we have you on video pushing away your beer
bottle after a third failed attempt at coherent speech the night before.... :)
Besides, who wants breakfast at the hotel when there are still 12-oz breakfast
bottles in the cooler? :)
                                                  ...Bob...

 ALL ATTENDEES ARE INVITED TO INTERJECT WHERE APPROPRIATE!

WWIVcon 98 took place the weekend of 21-23 August in Pigeon Forge Tennessee.

Attendees were:

Richard Claypool    aka Texan Hawk
Mike McShane        aka Snorkel
Randy Miller        aka Hobbit
Bob Milot
Dean Nash           aka Trader Jack
Jennifer Ogle       aka White Queen
Kent Ogle           aka The Prisoner
Frank Reid
Dennis Thompson     aka Maintech
Dave Toy            aka Dave

TJ and Hobbit arrived on Friday afternoon to find Snorkel, Dave, Bob, and
Texan Hawk already present and wondering where TJ was since he was supposed
to be there 2 hours earlier.  After check in and brief introductions, the
weary travelers adjourned to the pool gazebo to consume various and sundry
beverages and get to know each other a bit.  Later that evening, White Queen
and The Prisoner arrived and joined in the frey.

8pm Friday:  The recently refreshed mob journeyed to the Golden Coral by foot
to have dinner.  TJ noticed the funny looking tower on the way, but said
nothing to the assembled group.  After dinner, as the group walked back to
the hotel, TJ suggested that everyone take a jump off the bungee tower.
Hobbit was concerned that if he were to jump it may break the bungee so he
declined.  The brave trio of TJ, Bob and Texan Hawk paid their fee and
proceeded to suit up for the jump.  TJ felt he should be the first to jump,
setting the example for the others so he quickly climbed to the top of the
70 foot tower and prepared to meet his fate.  When the attendant asked
"Head first or feet first?" there was no doubt in his mind as to the method
he would employ.   TJ took the plunge head first quickly followed by Texan
Hawk, the first blind person to ever jump from the tower.  His comments
during the free fall were... shall we say, colorful.  Bob was the final
jumper and arrived on the ground without incident (or his glasses....).
After the hoopla concluded the mob and the adrenaline charged trio proceeded
back to the hotel for a few more 12 ounce curls and then off to bed in the
wee hours of the morning.

About 1:30am Saturday Morning: A bearded gentleman pulls up in the
parking lot of the Best Western Plaza Inn.  "Wonder where all those
sysop people are and where's my roomate?" The tardy wanderer walks of
in the direction of Room 282....

9am Saturday:  TJ plus family, Hobbit, and the recently arrived Maintech
departed for a fun filled day at Dollywood.  They were to meet the Reid
Clan at the gate but the mass of assembled Dollyfans precluded the link-up.
The Wild Bunch (Dave, Bob, and Texan Hawk) remained in a slovenly sleep as
a result of the previous evening.  What they really did Saturday and the
whereabouts of Snorkel remain a mystery to this day.  There was talk
of a county road some miles away that had an establishment where
scantily clad women....  I digress....  White Queen and The Prisoner passed
on the events of the day since they are from the area.

6pm Saturday:  The group assembled at the hotel and proceeded to the
Hiedelberg German Restaurant since the Alabama Grill was overbooked.
A fine German dinner accompanied by generous amounts of Wiezen beer and
music from an Oompah Band was enjoyed by all.  Hobbit took this opportunity
to demonstrate his skill in the "Chicken Dance" with TJ's daughter. Oh
stop you perverts.... she's only 8 years old.....

8pm Saturday:  Everyone assembled in the meeting room for an icebreaker and
a beer or two and enjoyed a variety of music provided by Miller Music.
Hobbit doubles as a DJ in addition to his duties as a WWIV Sysop.  TJ
conducted a brief demonstration of LNET-II for all those interested. About
9pm, TJ called the esteemed group to the round table for final introductions
and discussion.  TJ and Frank delivered their views on the future directions
for WWIV and answered many questions on a variety of issues.  With great
input from all present, the decision was made to set a milestone for the
release of 4.30 as a version that contained FOSSIL support and a few more
of the remaining functional changes.  Discussion moved on to future releases
for multiple platforms to include Windows, OS/2 and *nix, and BBS/Network
security.  Several ideas were presented that bear further research before
any announcement is made.  Varied discussion went on for three hours and
about 12am, TJ passed out WWIVcon T-shirts to all attendees.  Frank and
wife departed shortly after but the hardcores remained until almost 5am
talking and witnessing the antics of Texan Hawk.

9am Sunday:   Those not suffering from hangovers had a leisurely breakfast
at the hotel cafe, said their good-byes proceeded to depart for home.
