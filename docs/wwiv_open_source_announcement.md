WWIV Software Services announces changes in licensing program for
WWIV v5.0 and beyond

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Press Release: For IMMEDIATE distribution.

Gray TN, September 18 2004: WWIV Software Services (WSS) announces changes
in licensing program for
WWIV v5.0 and beyond.

Effective Monday, 20 September 2004, WWIV v5.0 will be licensed under the
Apache License v2.0 as an open source project.  WSS has procured the
services of Sourceforge.net® as the central repository for the distribution
of source code and submission of changes for final approval.  Information on
CVS access will be provided in a separate announcement at a later date.
WWIV will continue to be managed and developed under the control of WSS. The
networking package is NOT included in this licensing change as of this date.
A decision regarding release under this license will be made in the future
and will be announced here.

WSS feels that WWIV has long since outlived the shareware distribution
method and believes that movement to this licensing method will energize the
development process and allow dedicated creative minds to enhance the
feature set of the software in the future.

Shareware licensing of WWIV v4.30 has been terminated.  Effective 20
September 2004, registrations will be issued at no charge upon request to
disable the time/use restrictions on the software.

Please give this release the widest possible dissemination.
