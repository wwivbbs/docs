                    WWIV and WWIVNet Update From The New NC
                               By Weatherman 1@1

    As many know, lots of things have been happening with WWIV BBS and 
    WWIVnet over the past few years.  When Weather Station BBS came back 
    online as a virtual machine around three years ago, the only networks 
    that were available were FTN based.  About 7-8 months later, I was 
    approached by Eli Sanford to join WWIVSN (the early beginnings of the
    resurrected WWIVnet).  Eli spent lots of time helping others and 
    leading the path so that we could have a functional WWIV network like 
    years ago.

    On a very sad day (October 26, 2015), our WWIVnet leader Eli Sanford 
    passed from leukemia.  We were in shock and upset from the news. A few 
    weeks went by as we were mourning the loss of Eli and then later, 
    figuring out plans to keep WWIVnet alive.

    We agreed to meet in the WWIV chat room on Monday evening to decide 
    how to move forward.  The first item of business was determining the 
    new @1 node for WWIVnet.  Rushfan suggested myself and the rest of 
    the group was on-board with that change.  I was very humbled by the 
    votes of support and encouragement.  It has been my passion to keep 
    WWIV and WWIVnet alive in the most resiliant way possible.  My hardware
    setup is robust for a home environment and offers a good deal 
    redundancy. I will always do my best to make sure WWIVnet is running 
    the best way possible.

    That same night, we decided to make a historic change for WWIVnet.  
    We switched the entire network from using WINS (PPP Project) to 
    NetworkB (BinkP) written by Rushfan.  Given the magnatude of changes 
    that we made that night, I think it went fantastic!  We have been 
    running completely using BinkP for WWIVnet ever since.  It has proved 
    to be a major step forward!  I can't thank Rushfan enough for writing 
    that program, as that was a HUGE step forward!

    In more recent news, we now have the ability to send out network 
    updates using NetUp just like the legacy WWIVnet.  Rushfan provided a 
    custom compiled version of NetUp for our WWIVnet which has been working 
    perfectly sending out network updates, subs listings, and even this
    WWIVnet news.  This brings us back to the functionality that we had 
    with the legacy WWIVnet.  It has been well over a decade since this was
    possible.

    I am completely honored to be a part of such an excellent group of 
    people that have done so much for WWIV and WWIVnet in the past few 
    years. Highlighting the past few months as just nothing short of 
    incredible with the move to NetworkB (BinkP).  That was as huge of a 
    change for WWIVnet as when we started moving network packets using 
    Frank Reid's PPP Project (SMTP).

    This has been a very fun road for our hobby and I'm very excited for 
    what the future holds.  I'm sure as more people discover our 
    milestones, additional people will re-connect and join our fantastic 
    group.  We will also not forget Eli and all the hard work he did to 
    start the WWIVnet comeback.

    Here is a toast to the bright future of WWIV and WWIVnet!

                                By Rushfan 1@514

                                Main Themes
                                ~~~~~~~~~~~
    Messages and WWIVNet have always been at the heart of WWIV. For 5.1, I 
    plan on modernizing and improving the internal code quality of the 
    messaging code, making it easier to embed into new tools. Included in 
    this will be support for the JAM Message Base format to broaden the 
    range of tools available for exposing message bases.
    
    More on JAM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAM_Message_Base_Format

    Net38 will be finalized [currently Beta 6] and released supporting any 
    new changes to get WWIVNet functioning in the Internet era.
